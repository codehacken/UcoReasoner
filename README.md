# UcoReasoner
-------------
Current Ontology reasoners used in UCO are declarative and cannot handle minor changes in inputs leading to the inability to reason about about potential attacks when these changes happen. UcoReasoner is a probabilistic reasoner using a bayesian network (with graph search) to explore potential nearest neighbors that can be dropped in as replacements to antecedents in predefined rules.
